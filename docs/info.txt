Instructions:

This script only works with RuneLite, it has not been tested on other clients. The RuneLite window must be full screen and the client must be configured in modern-layout or the inventory will be dislocated causing click impressions, use ALT + v to verify.  It has not been tested on systems prior to windows7 or versions of linux.

To start, you must define an area containing a rock with iron, cooper or clay. To define a rock follow these steps:

Step 1 - Find the rock you want to mine and place the mouse pointer on one of its corners, then press Control + a, this will take the first corner of the area.

Step 2 - Press Control + a when you have the mouse pointer over the second corner of the area you want to define.

An area is built with two points that form a square, that's all.
 
If you define a very large area, for example containing a rock and empty ground, it is likely to be "MissClicked", to avoid this make sure you create areas that are the size of rocks or smaller. You can create small areas inside a rock. This increases accuracy, but reduces the chances of correctly detecting a mineral. One benefit of doing this is to avoid areas where an object can overlap, for example pickaxes or other players.

The script is designed to mine from one to three rocks and only if the character does not move from the square where he is. Avoid creating areas that are too far apart or the character could get out of place and require repositioning.

The script uses the last cell of the inventory to know if it is full, so it will not work well if you have any items in that cell (the cell below and to the right).

The first cell of the inventory is reserved for a picaxe, that's why the minerals are thrown from cell 2 to the last one.

Warnings:

Careless use can cause a temporary or permanent ban. Use at your own risk and discretion.

Recommendations to avoid a ban:

	> Use this program between 1 to 2 hours a day maximum, or even weekly. I had not tried constant use.

	> Avoid being reported while mining. I recommend mining in empty areas, there are a lot of places where nobody mine.

	> You need to avoid predictive behavior, others players can realize that you are doing things repetitively and reportd you. An example of repetitive behavior is if you use the program every day at the same time without doing anything diferent of mining. 

With the software you have the advantage of only having to do a few clicks, but don't leave the program unattended, that's not the point. You need to correct the behavior of the program often.

Finally remember that following these rules does not guarantee that you will not be banned. Jagex is always improving its anti-bot systems, how could it be so easy? However I used this program to create 4 accounts with 70 mining in a month effectively. It is also true that I got banned with almost 50 mining in just two days! LOL

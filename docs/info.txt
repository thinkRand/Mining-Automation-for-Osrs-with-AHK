Requirements:

	> Tested on Windows 7 and later.
	> Works with RuneLite.  It has not been tested on other clients.
	> Tested with AutoHotKey 1.1.34.03


Client Configs:

	> Client size between medium and full screen. Smallest size cause inventory misslocation.
	> Modern-layout or the inventory may be misslocated.
	> Ajust brightness if the rocks are not found, or if the inventory is not detected whe it is full.
	> Reload the script if you change the RuneLite's window position

Instructions:


	Inside OSRS press ALT + i To initiate the program and see
	the inventory location.

	Ensure that inventory is correct located.

	To start mining you must define a region containing a rock with iron, cooper
	or clay. To define a rock follow these steps:

	Step 1 - Find the rock you want to mine and place the mouse pointer on one
	of its corners, then press CTRL + Mouse Left Button, this will take the
	first corner of the region.

	Step 2 - Move the mouse pointer to the next corner and press CTRL + Mouse Left Button again.

	A region is built with two points that form a rectangle, that's all.
 
	If you define a very large region, for example containing a rock and empty
	ground, it is likely to be "MissClicked", to avoid this make sure you
	create regions that are the size of rocks or smaller. You can create
	small regions inside a rock. This increases accuracy, but reduces the
	chances of correctly detecting a mineral. One benefit of doing this is
	to avoid regions where an object can overlap, for example pickaxes or
	other players.

	The script is designed to mine from one to three rocks and only if the
	character does not move from the square where he is. Avoid creating
	regions that are too far apart or the character could get out of place
	and require repositioning.

	The script uses the last cell of the inventory to know if it is full, so it
	will not work well if you have any items in that cell (the cell below
	and to the right).

	The first cell of the inventory is reserved for a picaxe, that's why the
	minerals are thrown from cell 2 to the last one.

Warnings:

	Careless use can cause a temporary or permanent ban. Use at your own risk
	and discretion.

Recommendations to avoid a ban:

	> Use this program between 1 to 2 hours a day maximum, or even weekly. I had
	  not tried constant use.

	> Avoid being reported while mining. I recommend mining in empty areas,
	  there are a lot of places where nobody mine.

	> You need to avoid predictive behavior, others players can realize that you
	  are doing things repetitively and reportd you. An example of repetitive
	  behavior is if you use the program every day at the same time without
	  doing anything diferent of mining. 

Remarks:

	ALT + s, stops the scrip after one cycle, that means than it is not
	inmediately. It even doesent work while dropping items.
	
	The camera position can cause inconsistency. Change the camera angle if the
	script is working weirdo.

	With the software you have the advantage of only having to do a few clicks,
	but don't leave the program unattended, that's not the point. You need
	to correct the behavior of the program often.

	Finally remember that following these rules does not guarantee that you will
	not be banned. Jagex is always improving its anti-bot systems, how could
	it be so easy? However I used this program to create 4 accounts with 70
	mining in a month effectively. It is also true that I got banned with
	almost 50 mining in just two days! LOL
